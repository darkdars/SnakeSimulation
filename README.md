# SnakeSimulation
- Developed a JavaScript Snake Simulation using the library TensorFlow that learns to play the game by 
itself.
- Implemented Genetic Algorithms that selects the best snakes from the population and improves the 
learning rate of the neural network.
- Utilized: JavaScript, TensorFlow.js, P5.js and Genetic Algorithm
